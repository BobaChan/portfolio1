  <h2 style="color:purple; text-align:center;"> A little about me </h2>
  <p title="Just a littlee :)" style="text-align:center;"> I am going to be a senior in my upcoming school year.
    I currently go to Silver Creek High School. I was born on the morning of February 11th of the year 2000.
    That makes me a dragon in the Chinese zodiac, and as a coincidence I like dragons too; 
    or really mythical creatures in general. Many people, including my friends would probably say
    that I am a very credible person. I would probably agree. But I prefer too trusting over gullible. 
    Aside from that I am a very friendly person that tries really hard to make people feel 
    welcome and involved because in the end we are all here to help one another. Plus things are so much easier
    and so much more fun with a friend by your side! </p>
  
  <h2 style="color:green; text-align:center;"> A bit of the future and the past </h2>
  <p title="No time like the present!" style="text-align:center;"> I have an older sister who used to take care of me when I was younger. She lives in Reno now and we talk through texts,
    calls, and video calling. My dad is a hard-working man who has been doing the same job for more than 10 years I believe. 
    He works hard just to take care of me and my grandpa, and I am super thankful for him. My mother does not live with me currently 
    and that story was a sad one. However, I still see her at least once a week, so the situation did not turn out too bad! 
    The present is still happening, but I do plan on taking as many opportunities as I can, especially as a senior in high school! 
    The future is unknown but I do have an eye on what I wish to do, who I wish to become. I want to pursue a career in technology. 
    The jobs I have an inclination towards include: a computer scientist, an animator, and an engineer. Which one I am unsure, but I am 
    very passionate about all of these subjects! However, the future is pretty crazy so maybe I will find something I like that
    I never would have thought that I would like! I don't think I could enjoy anything more than those jobs but who knows... </p>

<h3> Now here are a few cute things I like! </h3>

  <h3 title="A recap on my day!" style="color:purple; text-align:center;"> Reflection - Week 2, Day 2 </h3>
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Python and Scratch have many things in common. Many of the ideas we learned in Scratch are visible in Python. For example, 
    variables, loops, functions, and conditionals are seen in both. The only difference would be that we learned different types of each 
    today with Python and we have a broader range of choices because we can write the code instead of relying solely on the blocks that
     are given in Scratch. A few differences would be the fact that Python code must be typed out while Scratch has blocks to interact with. 
    Also, Python has many commands that one must know and so it makes it easier to have bugs in the program as we type everything out while in 
    Scratch the actions are already there and the coder just has to be sure not to contradict themself in the code or something. Overall
    the two are very similar in ideas but the actual coding is simpler in Scratch than in Python. Yet both are very fun ways to creat new programs!
