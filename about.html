  <h2 style="color:purple; text-align:center;"> A little about me </h2>
  
  <p title="Just a littlee :)" style="text-align:center;"> I am going to be a senior in my upcoming school year.
    I currently go to Silver Creek High School. I was born on the morning of February 11th of the year 2000.
    That makes me a dragon in the Chinese zodiac, and as a coincidence I like dragons too; 
    or really mythical creatures in general. Many people, including my friends would probably say
    that I am a very credible person. I would probably agree. But I prefer too trusting over gullible. 
    Aside from that I am a very friendly person that tries really hard to make people feel 
    welcome and involved because in the end we are all here to help one another. Plus things are so much easier
    and so much more fun with a friend by your side! </p>
  
  <h2 style="color:green; text-align:center;"> A bit of the future and the past </h2>
  
  <p title="No time like the present!" style="text-align:center;"> I have an older sister who used to take care of me when I was younger. She lives in Reno now and we talk through texts,
    calls, and video calling. My dad is a hard-working man who has been doing the same job for more than 10 years I believe. 
    He works hard just to take care of me and my grandpa, and I am super thankful for him. My mother does not live with me currently 
    and that story was a sad one. However, I still see her at least once a week, so the situation did not turn out too bad! 
    The present is still happening, but I do plan on taking as many opportunities as I can, especially as a senior in high school! 
    The future is unknown but I do have an eye on what I wish to do, who I wish to become. I want to pursue a career in technology. 
    The jobs I have an inclination towards include: a computer scientist, an animator, and an engineer. Which one I am unsure, but I am 
    very passionate about all of these subjects! However, the future is pretty crazy so maybe I will find something I like that
    I never would have thought that I would like! I don't think I could enjoy anything more than those jobs but who knows... </p>

<h3 style="color:red; text-align:center;"> Now here are a few cute things I like! </h3>

  <h3 title="A recap on my day!" style="color:purple; text-align:center;"> Reflection - Week 2, Day 2 </h3>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Python and Scratch have many things in common. Many of the ideas we learned in Scratch are visible in Python. For example, 
    variables, loops, functions, and conditionals are seen in both. The only difference would be that we learned different types of each 
    today with Python and we have a broader range of choices because we can write the code instead of relying solely on the blocks that
     are given in Scratch. A few differences would be the fact that Python code must be typed out while Scratch has blocks to interact with. 
    Also, Python has many commands that one must know and so it makes it easier to have bugs in the program as we type everything out while in 
    Scratch the actions are already there and the coder just has to be sure not to contradict themself in the code or something. Overall
    the two are very similar in ideas but the actual coding is simpler in Scratch than in Python. Yet both are very fun ways to creat new programs!
  </p>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Yes today we spent plenty of time correcting bugs in our code. It was a bit frustrating and confusing at
    some points but the experience itself was ultimately fun. Situations involved but were not limited to: syntax mistakes, not knowing
    what each parameter meant in the page we used as reference and simply silly mistakes. I enjoyed the challenge that presented itself, 
    and although it was tough at times to find the solution to some bugs the aftermath was amazing. Finding the solution and finally
    getting the program to do what you initially wanted it to is a great feeling. After all if there is no hard work involved then the 
    end product is not as impactful as when there was. 
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="color:purple; text-align:center;"> Reflection - Week 2, Day 5 </h3>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> Today was filled with a ton of fun and frustration. First off, we learned about lists. A list is a 
    collection of independant values. There are many different things that we can use lists for. The lists are helpful when you want to 
    make random collections of words for fun, store a ton of data types for any need you may have such as the creation of games, 
    events, and so on. Lists are much more efficient than having various little variables with a ton of names that will get jumbled in 
    your head; or at least it would for me. Overall, lists are just more effective and practical when applied well.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> In each of my groups I think that the group that worked best together was Xiaotong and I. We were able to 
    extend our code in the text adventure really far and we overcame all of the problems we saw. However, in my other groups I really enjoyed 
    having a different set of eyes each day. </p> 
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> In python I really like how it tells you where you could have some bugs in your code. I think that Python
    is also really amazing because it is one of the first programming languages that I have actually used. Python is very intuitive, such 
    as how it does not require users to give the data type, and Python is very fun to see how the code comes along and how the user can 
    really interact with the programmer! </p>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> My idea of robotics changed a little because I realized that our world today is filled with them and 
    they are a very helpful addition to our society. I am excited to see how the world will innovate next but with the progress
    in technology there is also a chance for that technology to become a danger to people. </p>
  
  <p style="font-family:arial;"> In my group for circuits we ran into a couple problems but we were able to solve them each!
    We worked well together and had a lot of fun as we discussed the physics and randomness that came to mind. We understood
    the circuits fairly well and fairly quickly and there were only a couple instances that could have been improved by larger 
    LED lights - as a couple of ours burnt out. </p>

  <p> For this day in robotics, we were able to make our robot sense its surroundings and react to them. The whiskers were used to 
    provide the information for Buggy and although Buggy's behavior was strange sometimes it was very entertaining and satisfying to have completed
    that code!
